# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "User wants a working LAN-based e-learning system that stores file paths (C:\Documents\file.pdf, \\server\share\video.mp4, URLs) instead of uploading files. System should provide clear instructions for opening local files since browsers cannot open local files directly due to security restrictions. Current issues: 1) Frontend form submission for adding content needs verification, 2) Local file opening mechanism needs to be corrected to provide copy-to-clipboard instructions instead of failed direct opening attempts."

        comment: "✅ VERIFIED: Local File Opening with Instructions working excellently. The openContent function properly handles LAN files by copying file paths to clipboard and displaying comprehensive, file-type specific instructions. Instructions are OS-specific (File Explorer for Windows, Finder for Mac), provide step-by-step guidance, and include path-type specific directions for network paths vs local paths. Clipboard functionality confirmed working. This is the correct approach for LAN-based systems where browsers cannot directly access local files due to security restrictions."

The getFileType function correctly identifies file types from LAN paths, getFileIcon provides appropriate emojis for each file type (📕 for PDF, 🎥 for video, 📄 for documents, etc.), and getFileColor applies proper gradient colors (red for PDF, pink for video, blue for documents). Content cards display with proper styling, file path information is shown in monospace font, and file type-specific buttons are correctly labeled (📖 Open PDF, ▶️ Play Video, etc.)."
